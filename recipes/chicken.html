    <h3>Chicken breasts</h3>
    <p>This is a very easy recipe that only requires 3 ingredients. It also takes very little time to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir together melted butter and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Brush butter mixture onto chicken until thoroughly coated, pouring any extra over chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
